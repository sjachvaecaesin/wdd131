            AROUND 950 (note: Florin is about 30)
        
            Stumbleduck was founded in 953 by Florin Flavand, also known as the adventurer, Stumbleduck. Florin is a forest gnome whose community strove to keep hidden from outsiders. At the time of his youth, there was an increase in traffic in the area and the village elders foresaw that their community would not remain hidden if this trend were to continue. Most of the village elders thought that extreme measures would need to be taken to dissuade travelers from this area of the world, but Florin had a different view. Florin felt that he could divert the attention of the travelers by creating a city relatively near the community, then create a forest sanctuary that would be considered sacred and forbidden.
                
            He persuaded the elders to allow him to try. He began his adventuring by exploring the area, then by finding a few allies (Mantee the Strong, from the human barbarian clan to the east, Moradin, dwarven cleric of Moradin, and Big Tom Littlebrook, the skulking halfling from parts unknown) to join his cause, then by clearing the area of true threats. Together, the four of them ruled Stumbleduck and forbade anyone from entering the Hallowed Forest. 
            </p>
            <p>
            AROUND 1000 (note: Florin is about 80 and Harfindril is about 20)
                
            About 50 years after the founding of Stumbleduck, a new threat had emerged. The dragon, Flauxxim, had taken up residence in the mountain to the south, some 20 years earlier, and his influence was beginning to be felt in the area of Stumbleduck. By this time, Mantee had passed away, and Big Tom had left Stumbleduck for new adventures, never to have been heard from again. Florin and Moradin agreed that Moradin would gather some allies to rid the mountain of the great wyrm. Moradin, together with Harfindril, the high elf, Klaxx, the dragonborn, and Hugh, the peasant-wizard, who was apprentice to Florin, set out to lay siege to the mountain. 
                
            Working their way through 20 years of festering evil, the group reached the lair of Flauxxim. In the battle, Moradin fell. Yet, victorious were Harfindril, Klaxx, and Hugh. In counsel with Florin, it was determined that the trio would use the plunder to build ANOTHER city, to be allied with Stumbleduck and ruled by the victorious three.
                
            That was 150 years ago and, as you can imagine, Klaxx and Hugh have each succumbed to old age, leaving Harfindril, Elf King Under the Mountain, to be the sole ruler of Flauxxim, so named to remind all of the scourge that once was.
                
            Allied together, Stumbleduck and Flauxxim enjoyed great prosperity, though most of the commerce and growth flowed through Flauxxim. This was as Florin had designed, as fewer outsiders ventured into the area surrounding Stumbleduck and, more importantly, his childhood community. Even so, to the West was the small port town of Portage, which consisted of 3 families whose sole profession was to keep the port open. This meant that they fished the waters, thereby providing trade in the form of seafood, and that they received shipments of goods from far-away lands, taking in a portion of the shipments as payment for their part in the commerce. These trade goods that were once sent directly to Stumbleduck were now routed between Stumbleduck and Flauxxim. 
            </p>
            <p>
            AROUND 1050 (note: Florin is about 130 and Harfindril is about 70 and Garin is about 30)
                
            As Flauxxim grew, their need for goods grew, as well. Eventually, a new port was established to the south of Portage, resulting in the decline of an already small town. The port of South Portage became a bustling port-town with no clear government, other than the twin families who were primarily handling daily operations. Within 50 years of the establishment of Flauxxim, the port town of Portage had been reduced to one family living in abject poverty, save the overabundance of fish that they catch.
                
            Geographically, in the year 1053, Stumbleduck was situated at the southern edge of the great snow-capped Pynthos Mountains, about 30 miles east of the vast Chlorean Sea, and some 200 miles north of the famed mountain-city of Flauxxim, and another 100 miles north of the Berrian desert. Further to the east of Stumbleduck, the lands were once ruled by multiple marauding barbarian clans as far as the eye could see. By this time, Stumbleduck was dwarfed by the city of Flauxxim and, to be honest, an afterthought to all but those barbarians who would venture west. 
                
            As referenced above, an occasional barbarian or two would venture westward. When making the choice of venturing into the refined city of Flauxxim or the declining town of Stumbleduck, those barbarians would unilaterally choose Stumbleduck. For one thing, the town guard was not as intimidating as the city guard. The unfortunate result for Stumbleduck was an increase in damaging behavior. 
                
            It was about this time that Florin reflected upon the apparent success of the expedition that dealt with the dragon. Rather than thinking about the venture as one of “solving a problem,” Florin chose to think of it as one of, “building a buffer” between Stumbleduck and the rest of the world. This was all that was needed for Florin to decide to commission a new group of adventurers to head eastward to found a new city. 
                
            This time, the adventuring party consisted of Garin, the dwarven paladin, Horus, the teifling bard, and Bob, another human apprentice to Florin. Together, they ventured to the east, which was vast, and ultimately funneled their effort to the southeast. Their progress was slow, but effective, and within a few years, they had established what would best be described as an outpost. This outpost was about 250 miles southeast of Stumbleduck and maybe 200 miles northeast of Flauxxim. 
                
            Great were the songs sung by Horus regarding their exploits. The barbarians of the area were either tamed or driven northward and the outpost eventually grew to a small city. Clearly, the city of Wildefort would never approach the grandeur of Flauxxim, but it quickly surpassed the current state of Stumbleduck. The Berrian desert south of Flauxxim was also found south of Wildefort, and to the direct east of Wildefort was an expanse of marshland irrigated by way of several flowing branches of rivers stemming from the mountain-source Murkmeist River. 
                
            Yet once again, within 50 years of peaceful growth, Horus and Bob grew old and died, leaving Garin the Great as the Restless Dwarf-King without a Mountain. Garin’s initial allegiance with Stumbleduck was strong and much commerce flowed between the two cities. However, as is always the case with economics, the shorter and more lucrative path led between Wildefort and Flauxxim. The roads between these two locations were built up and fortified, while the path to Stumbleduck gradually became overgrown and almost forgotten, traveled once every few months by a lone merchant, more out of obligation than industry. 
                
            The barbarians, now isolated to the north of Wildefort, tended toward bartering in Wildefort, primarily because of their ties to the barbarian lineages that were tamed into city-life. Though this unsavory traffic now posed less trouble to Stumbleduck, Florin was oft-worried about the potential threat to his mission from that direction.

            ABOUT 1100 (note: Florin is about 180 and Harfindril is about 120 and Garin is about 80 and Hindleglind is about 20)
                
            By this time in history, the great city of Stumbleduck was a thing of the past. It’s once-majestic walls were about 150 years old, and they were showing their age. Though not vine-covered, there were definitely vines growing at various points. Shopkeepers earned enough to make a living, but the living that they made was provincial, at best. Newcomers to the city were rare and were typically the “talk of the town” for a couple of months, and the greater part came from Flauxxim, with a lesser number coming from Wildefort, and a trickle coming from Portage.
                
            With the stability in the area, Florin the Venerable felt that it was now time to further secure the safety and seclusion of his childhood community. To that end, Florin gathered together the company of Nishi Windwalker, the Teifling sorcerer, Hindleglind, the half-elven cleric-child of Harfindril, Magalog, the dragonborn mercenary, and Perry Furfoot, the halfing assassin. They ventured eastward and to the north into the barbarian-lands. The company enlisted the services of Mantau, an outcast ranger from one of the barbarian tribes, as a guide into the lands. 
                
            By this time, the barbarian clans had clustered into 5 large-ish villages. After several missions into the harsh territory, unsuccessfully trying to secure portions of the land, the group determined that they would separate and each hero would lead a group in attacking a different village. Through a series of virtually miraculous events, each of the 5 attack forces was able to defeat it’s targeted village, with few to no barbarians surviving by being driven out. The barbarian threat to Stumbleduck was now gone. 
                
            The heroes had been unable to put aside their differences in order to successfully work together to capture the land, but were able to work independently to accomplish that task. Despite the counsel of Florin that the company build one, central city in the area and rule from that city, the heroes chose jealousy and envy; they each built a small fortification in their respective victory-sites: Murkmeist, Riverton, Trickleton, Furfoot, and Mantau Al’ Antau, each best being described as a small town. 
                
            Through the next several decades, none of these small towns ever had the nerve to take up arms against any of the others, but the strife and envies grew and tensions have been increasingly strained. Commerce between these towns is virtually non-existent. Merchants from each town would rather make the trek to Wildefort to do business before they would trade with their closest neighbors. This attitude, coupled with the inhospitable landscape, has stunted the growth of each of these towns. 
                
            Within the first 50 years of their existence, 3 of the 5 rulers have died due to old age. The only living heroes from the original company were Hindleglind of Riverton and Perry Furfoot of Furfoot. The governments of the other 3 towns have been loose, to say the least, with crime in abundance. There has been talk of Hindleglind trying to unite the 5 towns, but most of the inhabitants of the 5 towns outside of Riverton believe that Hindleglind intends to conquer them, so there is a great deal of resistance to his efforts.

            ABOUT 1150 (note: Florin is about 230, Harfindril is about 170, Garin is about 130, Hindleglind is about 70, and Perry Furfoot is about 100)
